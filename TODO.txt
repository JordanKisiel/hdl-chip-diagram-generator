  TODO:
  -re-work (and test) the grid class to create and use a 2d-array of points
    -grid.get(0, 0) = (0, 0) # actual pixel values of grid coords
    -grid.snap_x(point, left=True) # returns point where x has been moved
      left or right to nearest y-div
    -grid.snap_y(point, up=True)
    -grid.snap(point, left=True, up=True)
    -grid.is_on_grid_x(point) # returns boolean indicating if point x coord
      is within threshold of a grid x div
    -grid.is_on_grid_y(point)
    -grid.is_grid_point(point)
    -grid.get_neighbors(point) # checks one div away in all directions and
      returns any of those points that are grid.is_grid_point()
    -grid.draw(canvas) 

  -re-work canvas to not know about grids
  -use pathfinding algo to draw connections between the connection points  
    -first I need to create a function or something that will tell me
    when I'm inside a part so I can avoid drawing connections through parts
      -ideally this can be part of the behavior of the boundary object
    -concern:
      -it's possible that wires will draw along the same grid lines for long
      portions of their path which may make it hard to see what's actually
      happening
      -maybe I can use the connection point data to avoid using the same
      grid points and lines
    -thought:
      -the start and end connection points won't be on a grid line in most
      cases, so I'll need to draw a line that connects each point to the
      grid
  -create a visitor that draws a tree of the AST
    -this should be relatively easy (maybe?) and illustrative of why it's called
    a syntax tree
  -add error handling and reporting for parser errors
    -go back to the crafting interpreters book for this but keep in mind
    that I WILL have a separate error class since I will have more possible
    errors that can occur
  -figure out how I want to handle checking other sorts of rules
    -first review rules to make sure they're categorized the way I want
    -make the all the parts that have rules associated with them (like the
    chip graph) first before making some sort of extraneous rule verifier
      -ideally all the rules for chips would be encoded naturally in parts of
      the system I'm constructing

  -find relationships between elements (margins, etc.)
  
  
  
  -SAVE THIS FOR A LATER DATE IF I REALLY WANT TO:
    -figure out how to recursively expand custom chip parts so that their
  internals can be drawn in the diagram
