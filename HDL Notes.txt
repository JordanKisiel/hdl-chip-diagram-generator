-the order of the internal parts doesn't matter as long as all the chips
are wired up correctly
    -question: how would I verify the correctness of the wiring? some sort of graph or tree algorithm?
-there are no expressions (i.e. nothing that evaluates multiple tokens to a value)
-all numbers are integers and used only for 3 purposes:
    -specifying bus widths
    -specifying bus ranges
    -as a constant input (0 or 1 only)
-the only operator is the = assignment operator that allows specification
of wiring up of inputs and outputs
-there is no control flow (no ifs or loops)
